## Introduction

Hugging Face provides user-friendly tools and pre-trained models to accelerate NLP tasks. This repository demonstrates various applications like sentiment analysis, question answering, dataset manipulation, and text classification using Hugging Face libraries.

---

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify text as `POSITIVE` or `NEGATIVE` using a DistilBERT model fine-tuned on the SST-2 dataset.
- **Dataset Manipulation**: Filter, slice, and analyze datasets for ML tasks.
- **Text Classification**: Detect grammatical errors or categorize text dynamically into predefined labels.
- **Question Answering**: Extract relevant answers from input text using a Q&A pipeline.
- **Dynamic Category Assignment**: Assign text into predefined categories without additional model training.
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Seamlessly extract text from PDF files.
- **AutoClasses Integration**: Combine `AutoModels` and `AutoTokenizers` with Hugging Face pipelines for streamlined workflows.
